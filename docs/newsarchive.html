                <li>
                    Reverted back to libsndfile 1.0.27 from 1.0.28, as the newer version crashes when encoding to FLAC format

                    Fixed crashes in ID3 tag library; reported in CVE-2008-2109, CVE-2017-11550 and CVE-2017-11551, details at http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2017/Jul/85

                <li>
                    When writing a playlist file and the option "use input folder as output location" is used, use the folder common to all files to store the playlist

        <p>
            Today I released another beta version of winLAME. This version only contains bug fixes
            and new encoder and decoder libraries. Note that from this version on, Windows XP is

                    Fix for bug when encoding many files on a multi-core CPU, where files
                    couldn't be written properly and winLAME eventually crash. See
                    <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/winlame/bugs/67/">bug #67</a>.

                </li>
                <li>
                    New Opus coded version 1.2.1 (see

                </li>
                <li>
                    New libsndfile library 1.0.28, a bugfix release (see

                </li>
                <li>
                    Support for 32-bit sample path when using LAME 3.100 (not released yet) and an
                    input module that also supports 32-bit samples (FLAC, MAD mp3, Monkey's Audio,
                    libsndfile).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Fixed bug when encoding reported an error and the output file is overwritten,
                    even if it doesn't need to be.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Tags: Reading and writing of AlbumArtist and Composer tag info is now
                    supported for MP3, Opus, Ogg Vorbis and WMA.

        <h2>2017-03-24 - winLAME 2017 beta 1 released</h2>
        <p>
            Today I released a new version of winLAME. The new version has an all new user
            interface that makes it possible to use your multicore CPU to encode several files in
            parallel, called "Modern UI". The previously used wizard UI that is used in winLAME
            2010 is still available and is called "Classic UI" now.
        </p>
        <p>
            The new release also contains the newest encoder and decoder libraries, as well as
            many bug fixes over the old versions. Please check the "About" dialog in winLAME for
            the actual encoder versions contained in winLAME.
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
            Note that this software is in beta status and may still contain bugs. You're welcome
            to test out the application and report errors! I plan to do a "beta 2" version in the
            next weeks, or when there is the need to fix some very nasty bugs.
