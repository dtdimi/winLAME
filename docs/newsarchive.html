        <p>
            Today I released winLAME 2020 release 1, which corresponds to the build number

        <h2>2020-07-03 - freedb replacement service</h2>

        <p>
            winLAME used the Freedb service for looking up CD disc and track metadata that is used
            to fill the audio tags (like ID3v2) during encoding. It seems the Freedb service,
            always provided for free by Magix, is no more. There are some alternatives, like
            <a href="http://www.gnudb.org/">gnudb</a>, that provide similar services.
        </p>

        <p>
            With the new AppVeyor build 2.20.0.79 (or any later build version) the default Freedb
            service in winLAME is now gnudb. You always can get AppVeyor builds here:

            "2018 release":
            <ul>
                <li>library updates: ogg 1.3.4, opus 1.3.1, FLAC 1.3.3, libfaac 1.30, libfaad2 2.9.1, libsndfile 1.0.29pre2, mpg123 1.25.13, Monkey's Audio 5.11, BASS 2.4.14 and BASSCD 2.4.7</li>

            </ul>

            The following bug fixes are included:

        <h2>2019-12-03 - winLAME on GitHub, automated builds on AppVeyor</h2>

        <p>
            Today I'm not going to announce a new version (yet). Instead I have some
            infrastructure news. First is, the winLAME source code is also hosted on
            <a href="https://github.com/vividos/winLAME">GitHub</a> where the repository can be
            cloned and forked by anyone. The Git repository on
            <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/winlame/code/ci/master/tree/">SourceForge</a> also
            still exists and contains the same code.
        </p>

        <p>
            The second news is that automatically built versions of winLAME are available via the
            <a href="https://ci.appveyor.com/project/vividos/winlame/build/artifacts">AppVeyor build service</a>.
            The automated build is always triggered when I commit changes to the source code
            repository, while using an incremeted version number. That way, you as the winLAME
            user always can download and use the latest winLAME version and don't have to wait for
            an official release.
        </p>

        <p>
            As the build artifacts on AppVeyor expire after 6 months, I will occasionally release
            an "official" winLAME version that I will also put on the
            <a href="download.html" title="Download">Download page</a>. Note that the version
            numbers follow a scheme: The (at this moment) current version is 2.19.0.60. The first
            two numbers describe the year of the release (2.19 = 2019, 2.20 = 2020). The next
            number is the number of the release (0 means the beta version, 1 and avove the first
            and following releases). 60 means it's the 60th build overall, and the number is
            increasing all the time, without being reset to 0.
        </p>

        <p>
            So enjoy the beta builds currently available on AppVeyor and report bugs, if you find
            one. I'm planning to release a 2019 release version in a few weeks.
        </p>

        <h2>2018-12-24 - winLAME 2018 release</h2>

                <li>Prevented selecting a data track when reading CDs</li>

                <li>

                <li>
                    When writing a playlist file and the option "use input folder as output location" is used, use the folder common to all files to store the playlist
                </li>

        <h2>2017-09-24 - Beta 1 survey results</h2>

        <p>
            Starting from winLAME 2017 beta 1 there are two buttons "Send a Smile" and "Send a
            Frown" in winLAME where you can fill out a short 2-question survey. I collected all
            answers from the "beta 1" time frame and summarized them. Here are the

        <h2>2017-09-06 - winLAME 2017 beta 2 released</h2>

        <p>
            Today I released another beta version of winLAME. This version only contains bug fixes
            and new encoder and decoder libraries. Note that from this version on, Windows XP is
            not a supported operating system anymore.
        </p>
        <p>
            The following changes were made to winLAME:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Fix for bug when encoding many files on a multi-core CPU, where files
                    couldn't be written properly and winLAME eventually crash. See
                    <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/winlame/bugs/67/">bug #67</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Possible fix for writing output files with Cyrillic or other non-ASCII
                    characters. See
                    <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/winlame/bugs/66/">bug #66</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    New Opus coded version 1.2.1 (see
                    <a href="http://www.opus-codec.org/">Opus Codec homepage</a>)
                </li>
                <li>
                    New libsndfile library 1.0.28, a bugfix release (see
                    <a href="http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/">libsndfile homepage</a>)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Support for 32-bit sample path when using LAME 3.100 (not released yet) and an
                    input module that also supports 32-bit samples (FLAC, MAD mp3, Monkey's Audio,
                    libsndfile).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Fixed bug when encoding reported an error and the output file is overwritten,
                    even if it doesn't need to be.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Tags: Reading and writing of AlbumArtist and Composer tag info is now
                    supported for MP3, Opus, Ogg Vorbis and WMA.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>2017-03-24 - winLAME 2017 beta 1 released</h2>
        <p>
            Today I released a new version of winLAME. The new version has an all new user
            interface that makes it possible to use your multicore CPU to encode several files in
            parallel, called "Modern UI". The previously used wizard UI that is used in winLAME
            2010 is still available and is called "Classic UI" now.
        </p>
        <p>
            The new release also contains the newest encoder and decoder libraries, as well as
            many bug fixes over the old versions. Please check the "About" dialog in winLAME for
            the actual encoder versions contained in winLAME.
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
            Note that this software is in beta status and may still contain bugs. You're welcome
            to test out the application and report errors! I plan to do a "beta 2" version in the
            next weeks, or when there is the need to fix some very nasty bugs.
